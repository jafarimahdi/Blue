    <h1>How She Got There</h1>
    <h2>An interview with Mule Design’s Erika Hall about philosophy, phone calls and her professional journey.</h2>
    <p>
      <em>
        In the fall of 2013 I interviewed Erika Hall, co-founder of
        <a href="http://muledesign.com/" target="_blank"> Mule Design Studio</a>,
        one of the most influential design practices in North America.
        It was the first of fourteen interviews that I would conduct for my book <a href="http://howtheygotthere.com/"
          target="blanck"> How They Got There:
          Interviews With Digital Designers</a> About Their Careers, and so in many ways it was the most important, too.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        Erika had been profiled numerous times in many different forums, and her insights on design, business and
        technology were well known. I was after something narrower, though. I wanted to hear about the nitty gritty of
        her professional journey, the trials and tribulations she encountered in finding meaningful work, and the
        stories of her lucky breaks and less lucky mishaps. The goal of<a href="http://howtheygotthere.com"
          target='_blanck'> How They Got There</a> was to document the random things that conspire together to forge
        every career, even very high profile ones like Erika’s.
